// Initializes a new game, runs it, and disposes of it when done.

} //TODO Now: clean up comments & such  
  //TODO Then: maybe comment out score, & just implement controls/instructions
  //TODO Later: Try to minimize blinkiness
  //TODO Later: See if you can prevent line skipping when in close range. Issue: lines draw a smidge behind the bike, rather than immediately behind the center point, so if you turn tight enough, you can slip through the space 1/2 of a bike's length.
  
  //Beyond Class:
  //	TODO Afterwards: Implement an enemy - a new Bike object, with it's own orientation var, but can hopefully use same linked list. Add a method in LightBikeGame to randomly generate orientation, & to have it turn when near boundaries.
  //	TODO Even Later: Work on interface Score/Lives not empty
  			//if do score, maybe just see how many pixels are in the linkedList, and use that number. This would even automatically double the score when enemies present!


  //NOTE: Can't retrieve variables with . operator. It only allows you to access methods, so you may need getters/setters.
