HOW TO USE THIS ASSEMBLER:

This Assembler is built in Processing 3, and is most easily run in the Processing 3 IDE.
	The built-in NAND to Tetris test programs are all included in the TestPrograms folder for convenience. However, feel free to use a test program of your own.
	All test-programs must end in .asm, and all programs will be output in .hack files.

Before running the program:
	1) Drag the desired test program into the "Main" folder.
	2) Go into the Main.pde file, and edit the "fileName" variable in line 1 to store the name of the file WITHOUT a file extension.

Run the program via the Processing IDE.

The resulting file will be created in the "Main" folder.





Thank you for making this semester awesome! It has been a lot of fun.
